  <p>Privacy Policy for Asha by Healthaid
Effective Date: September 28, 2025
Healthaid, Inc. ("Healthaid," "we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with the Asha by Healthaid mobile application (the "App"). The App is an iOS-based AI assistant that helps users prepare for doctor visits by suggesting questions and providing general information. Importantly, the App operates entirely on your device, and we do not collect, store, or access any personal data from users.
1. Information We Do Not Collect
We do not collect any personal information, health data, or conversation details from the App. All interactions, including AI-generated suggestions and user inputs, are processed and stored locally on your iOS device. No data is transmitted to our servers or any third parties. We do not use cookies, trackers, or analytics tools that gather user data.
2. How We Use Information
Since we do not collect any information, there is no use, sharing, or disclosure of user data. The App's functionality is self-contained on your device to ensure maximum privacy.
3. Data Storage and Security
Conversations and any data you input are stored locally on your device using standard iOS security features. You are responsible for securing your device, including using passcodes, biometric authentication, and keeping your iOS software up to date. We recommend backing up your device regularly, but note that local data may be included in such backups.
In the event of a security vulnerability in the App, we will promptly release updates via the Apple App Store. It is your responsibility to install these updates.
4. No Sharing or Selling of Data
We do not share, sell, rent, or otherwise disclose any user data to third parties, as no data is collected. The App does not integrate with any external services that could access your information.
5. Children's Privacy
The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided information through the App (though unlikely given our no-collection policy), we will take steps to delete such information if it exists.
6. International Users
The App is hosted and operated in the United States. If you are accessing the App from outside the United States, you are responsible for compliance with local laws regarding data privacy.
7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated policy in the App or on our website at Healthaid.app. Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
8. Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at support@healthaid.app.
This Privacy Policy is designed to be transparent and straightforward, reflecting our commitment to user privacy.
Disclaimer: This Terms of Service and Privacy Policy are provided for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice. We strongly recommend consulting with a qualified attorney to customize these documents to your specific needs and ensure compliance with all applicable laws.</p>
