  <p>Terms of Service for Asha by Healthaid
Effective Date: September 28, 2025
These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Asha by Healthaid mobile application (the "App"), provided by Healthaid, Inc. ("Healthaid," "we," "us," or "our"). The App is an iOS-based AI assistant designed to help users prepare for and navigate doctor visits by suggesting relevant questions and providing general informational support. By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not download, install, access, or use the App.
IMPORTANT NOTICE: THE APP IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE, DIAGNOSIS, OR TREATMENT. ALWAYS SEEK THE ADVICE OF YOUR PHYSICIAN OR OTHER QUALIFIED HEALTH PROVIDER WITH ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE REGARDING A MEDICAL CONDITION. NEVER DISREGARD PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE OR DELAY IN SEEKING IT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING YOU HAVE READ OR RECEIVED THROUGH THE APP. IN CASE OF A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, CALL YOUR LOCAL EMERGENCY SERVICES IMMEDIATELY.
1. Eligibility
You must be at least 18 years old or the age of majority in your jurisdiction to use the App. By using the App, you represent and warrant that you meet this eligibility requirement. If you are using the App on behalf of another person (e.g., as a caregiver), you represent that you have the legal authority to do so and agree to these Terms on their behalf.
2. License to Use the App
Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download, install, and use the App on your personal iOS device for your own non-commercial use. You may not:

Modify, disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer the App;
Rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the App;
Use the App for any commercial purpose without our prior written consent;
Remove or alter any proprietary notices or labels in the App;
Use the App in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations.

3. Description of the Service
The App provides AI-generated suggestions for questions and general information to assist users during doctor visits. All content and suggestions are for informational purposes only and are not intended to provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The AI functionality operates entirely on your device, with conversations stored locally. We do not collect, transmit, or access any user data or conversations from the App.
4. User Content and Conduct
Any information you input into the App (e.g., conversation details) remains on your device and is not shared with us. You are solely responsible for the accuracy, completeness, and appropriateness of any content you provide to the App. You agree not to use the App to:

Upload or input illegal, harmful, or offensive content;
Infringe on the rights of others, including intellectual property rights;
Transmit viruses, malware, or other harmful code;
Engage in any activity that interferes with the App's functionality or security.

5. Intellectual Property
The App, including all software, design, text, graphics, and underlying technology, is owned by Healthaid or its licensors and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.

6. Disclaimers
THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ACCURACY. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR FREE FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THE APP.
HEALTHAID IS NOT A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER AND DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL SERVICES. THE APP'S SUGGESTIONS ARE GENERAL IN NATURE AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON FOR MEDICAL DECISIONS. YOU ASSUME ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH USING THE APP, INCLUDING ANY RELIANCE ON ITS CONTENT.
7. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, HEALTHAID, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE APP, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US FOR THE APP IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM, OR ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100), WHICHEVER IS GREATER. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
8. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Healthaid, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and licensors from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to: (a) your use of the App; (b) your violation of these Terms; (c) your violation of any rights of a third party; or (d) any content you provide to the App.

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.
